Upgrading from 3 to 5:

Some nice Find and Replace tricks:
 "label label-" to "badge bg-" then perhaps "bg-warning" to "bg-warning text-dark"
 "panel" to "card"
 "panel-heading" to "card-header"
 "panel-title" to "card-title"
 "panel-body" to "card-body"
 "help-block" to "form-text"
  input type="checkbox" to input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input"
  input type="radio" to input type="radio" class="form-check-input"
  "input-group-addon" to "input-group-text"

dl-horizontal is not a thing anymore, so style them with grid:
    <dl class="dl-horizontal"> becomes <dl class="row">
    <dt> becomes <dt class="col-md-4">
    <dd> becomes <dd class="col-md-8">

btn-default isn't a think anymore, closest is btn-secondary or btn-outline-secondary

For alerts that are .alert-dismissible, add .fade and .show and then replace:
<button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span><span class="sr-only">Close</span></button>
with
<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close"></button>
