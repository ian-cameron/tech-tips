When hosting a site on IIS, the code runs as a local user created for the application pool. You won't see these pool accounts in your computers User Manager, and if you delete an application pool the user will also be.

Scenario:  Your site stores data in a folder, or downloads files from there.  The account the 
application pool runs under needs filesystem permissions to access the folder.
Edit permissions and add "IIS AppPool\<pool name>"
