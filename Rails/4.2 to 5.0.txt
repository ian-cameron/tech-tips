add application_record.rb to app/models with:
     class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
       self.abstract_class = true
     end
and change all your models to inherit from ApplicationRecord

before_filter has been deprecated in Rails 5.0 and removed in 5.1. Use before_action instead

redirect_to :back has been deprecated
change them to eg) redirect_back :fallback_location => "/"

if you get errors about sprockets manifest:
create /app/assets/config/manifest.js with this content:
//= link_tree ../images
//= link_directory ../javascripts .js
//= link_directory ../stylesheets .css


content_tag_for and div_for have been removed in favor of just using content_tag:
eg) change <%= div_for item do %> to <%= content_tag :div, item do %>
or use record_tag_helper gem

In models with polymorphic association, such as belongs_to :imageable, :polymorphic => true
make sure to add , optional: true

Similarly, the belongs_to relationship is not optional by default in Rails 5 so if you had it optional, must declare optional: true
