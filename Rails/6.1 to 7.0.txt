Rails 7 requires Ruby 2.7.0 or newer

rvm get stable

if it failes try:
  rvmsudo rvm cleanup all
  rvm fix-permissions

then
rvm install 3.2.2

gem 'rails', '~> 7.0' 
bundle update rails

rails app:update

remove activestorage migrations if you aren't using it.

button_to helper will use a PATCH method, if you need to preserve a post you can explicity add it:
button_to("Do a POST", my_action_on_workshop_path(@workshop), method: :post)

activestorage image variants processor is now vips by default and has different syntax.  you can keep mini_magick though

-----------------------------------------------------------
The big thing is that webpacker is no longer required,  hope you didn't spend too much time
updating to use webpacker with 6.0.  Now you can use sprokets or its successor propshaft.

There is a gem for 'cssbundling-rails'
Run ./bin/bundle add cssbundling-rails
Run ./bin/rails css:install:[tailwind|bootstrap|bulma|postcss|sass]

when developing, start .bin/dev in another window to watch for css changes.

or keep using sprokets.  its not included in Rails 7, you need to add to Gemfile:
gem 'sprockets-rails'

(For javascipt bundling, see the file 'Webpacker to esbuild')
