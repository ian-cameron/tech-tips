Rails 7 requires Ruby 2.7.0 or newer

rvm get stable

if it failes try:
  rvmsudo rvm cleanup all
  rvm fix-permissions

then
rvm install 3.2.2

gem 'rails', '~> 7.0.0' 
bundle update rails

rails app:update

if you get an error about `uninitialized constant ActiveSupport::LoggerThreadSafeLevel::Logger (NameError)`
add to config/boot.rb:
  require "logger"

remove activestorage migrations if you aren't using it, or run migrations.

formtastic gem ~> 4.0 needed then run rails g formtastic:install (For ruby > 2.7)

add gem 'puma' if you dont have a devserver

button_to helper will use a PATCH method, if you need to preserve a post you can explicity add it:
button_to("Do a POST", my_action_on_workshop_path(@workshop), method: :post)

activestorage image variants processor is now vips by default and has different syntax.  you can keep mini_magick though

active storage attachment.service_url is removed.  Now its just attachment.url for the direct url.

-----------------------------------------------------------
The big thing is that webpacker is no longer required,  hope you didn't spend too much time
updating to use webpacker with 6.0.  Now you can use sprokets or its successor propshaft.

There is a gem for 'cssbundling-rails'
Run ./bin/bundle add cssbundling-rails
Run ./bin/rails css:install:[tailwind|bootstrap|bulma|postcss|sass]

when developing, start .bin/dev in another window to watch for css changes.

or keep using sprokets.  its not included in Rails 7, you need to add to Gemfile:
gem 'sprockets-rails'

(For javascipt bundling, see the file 'Webpacker to esbuild')

Having an extension in the partial name was deprecated in Rails 6.1 and removed in Rails 7. 
Change
<%= render "map_decoration.js.erb" %>
to
<%= render partial: "map_decoration", formats: :js %>

If you get 'LoadError: cannot load such file -- rexml/document'
add gem 'rexml' to Gemfile.  Ruby 3+ no longer includes it by default.
