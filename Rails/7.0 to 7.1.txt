You need at least Ruby 2.7 set up.  But since Rails 8 requires > 3.2 its recommened to update to >= 3.2  (supported on Rails > 7.0.1)
Add gem 'rails', '~> 7.1.0'
Run `bundle update`
Then run rails app:update

Rails 7.1 no longer logs to produciton.log file in Production by default!
check your config/environments/produciton.rb and change

  config.logger   = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.logger(STDOUT)
  to  
  config.logger   = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.logger("log/production.log")
