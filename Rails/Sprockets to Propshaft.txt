Remove some gems using the following:

bundle remove sprockets
bundle remove sprockets-rails
bundle remove sass-rails
bundle remove sassc-rails
bundle add propshaft

Delete the config/assets.rb and app/assets/config/manifest.js files from your project.

If you are Rails < 8 you'll need to comment out any calls to config.assets, such as in environments/development.rb:
  # Suppress logger output for asset requests.
  # config.assets.quiet = true

if you want to use a bundler, it is cssbundling-rails

add gem cssbundling-rails to the Gemfile
bundle install
run ./bin/rails css:install:sass
(This configures a node script in package.json to bundle and compress your sass and css stylesheets, installs foreman and bin/dev)
Remake your /assets/stylesheet/application.saas.scss 
change //=requires into @import for things in the tree
You can add other files you'll see when you run
`rake assets:reveal`
That will show vendored css files from gems, and everything else on your asset paths.
To use those from a gem, if they are css files, you can directly do it with
eg) @import url(formtastic.css);
however this will cause it to be a separate request, not bundled with cssbundling-rails.
If you want to bundle in gem styles, add some rails code to copy the style from your gemset.  for example:
add to /config/initializers/assets.rb:
    formtastic_path = Gem.loaded_specs['formtastic'].full_gem_path
    source = File.join(formtastic_path, 'app/assets/stylesheets/formtastic.css')
    destination = Rails.root.join('app/assets/builds/')
    FileUtils.cp(source, destination)

Then in your application.sass.scss put @use "../builds/formtastic"; (without the css extension)
or if there's other CSS you require from a node package, you'd need to copy it to /assets/build for example add to package.json:
    "build:css:fontawesome": "cp -r ./node_modules/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/webfonts ./app/assets/builds && sass ./app/assets/stylesheets/fontawesome.scss ./app/assets/builds/fontawesome.css --no-source-map --load-path=node_modules --quiet"

unlike with sprockets, not all .css files are automatically bundled.  you have to @use them in application.sass.scss and in order to @use them you need to rename them to start with _underscore.scss then you can use them with:
@use "example"  ->  will add "_example.scss" file to the bundle.  Order matters.

if you had files named example.css.scss you need to remove the .css part to @use them, eg) example.scss
Any .scss file that uses variables will need to @use "variables" (or whatever _file.scss you declare your variables and mixins in)

To add CSS compression(minification), edit package.json and add to the build:css script "--style=compressed"
To minify the JS bundle add --minify to the esbuild command in package.json

gem install foreman
get used to starting ./bin/dev instead of rails -s, which will start both a css and js hot reloader and rails server!
