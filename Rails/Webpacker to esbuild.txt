Webpacker, a rails JS bundler that uses Webpack, was requied in Rails 6. 
It made things complicated for simple use cases.  After Rails 7, we can
get away from Webpacker and use 'jsbundling-rails' gem, which could still 
use Webpack if you needed, but for apps with only a sprinkling of JS we
need something simple.  This is esbuild.  This will describe how to rip out
Webpacker and simplify.  (One thing webpacker had was HOT MODULE RELOADING so
with a plain esbuild if you edit .js you will need to do a page refresh again.)

gem 'jsbundling-rails'
bundle install
rails javascript:install:esbuild

This creates app/assets/builds which is where bundles will live
It also creates a ./bin/dev script which will help you run a dev server 
to watch .js files for changes and rebundle them during development.

It should add a build script to your package.json, such as:
"scripts": { "build": "esbuild app/javascript/*.* --bundle --sourcemap --outdir=app/assets/builds"  }
if it didn't or you skiped it, add it manually.

Webpacker made you swap in  'javascript_pack_tag' but now you get to go back
to 'javascript_include_tag'

The new entry point is app/javascript/application.js, so move it and eveyrthing else over from 
the app/javascript/packs/.

Change any requires() to imports:
eg)
require("@rails/ujs").start()
becomes
import Rails from “@rails/ujs”
Rails.starts()

change any import ../src/scripts.js to import ./src/scripts.js

You can delete:
./bin/webpack
./bin/webpack-dev-server
./config/initializers/webpacker.rb
./config/webpacker.yml
./config/webpack/*
./config/webpack/*
./config/webpack/*
./config/webpack/*

remove gem 'webpacker' from Gemfile
remove webpacker from package.json: yarn remove @rails/webpacker webpack-dev-server

jQuery (if required)
create app/javascript/jquery.js:

import jquery from "jquery"
window.jQuery = jquery
window.$ = jquery

and add to application.js:
import "./jquery"

^ this is important if you need $.fn.jQuery to be available in other scripts.  Hoisting will not let you combine the import in one file.

or add it directly to application.js

If you had global variables with webpacker, you had to change window to global.window.

Have a relatively newer version of npm.  For rails 7 you need npm --version > 7.1
npm install -g npm@7.1

or update node to 20
$ curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -

Then run npm install
