3 steps to do this, assuming you have rails ~> 6.1 and paperclip up and running fine and want to migrate it all to activestorage.  They are incompatible with eachother so thats why there are distinct steps.  Essetnialy they are

1) export the paperclip file locations and infomation about which model they are attached to to a CSV file
2) upgrade all the application code to ActiveStorage and remove paperclip.
3) use activestorage to attach all the paperclip files in the CSV to the right models and activestorge paths.

Create a file under /lib/tasks/paperclip_to_active_storage.rake
````
require 'csv'
namespace 'attachments' do
    task :export => :environment do
      Rails.application.eager_load!
      models = ActiveRecord::Base.descendants.reject(&:abstract_class?)
      # If using polymorphic attachments that aren't detected in the line above, you can just list your classes to migrate from here:
      # models = [Photo, Website]
      puts "Task started"
      filename = "paperclip_attachments.csv"
      csv_file = CSV.open(filename, "w") do |csv|
        csv << %w{MODEL ID TYPE URL FILENAME CONTENT_TYPE}
        models.each do |model|
          puts "#{model}"
          attachments = model.column_names.map do |c|
            if c =~ /(.+)_file_name$/
              $1
            end
          end.compact
          if attachments.blank?
            next
          end
          model.find_each.each do |instance|
            attachments.each do |attachment|
              if instance.send(attachment).path.blank?
                next
              end
              file_name = instance.send("#{attachment}_file_name")
              url = instance.send(attachment).url
              content_type = instance.send(attachment).content_type
              csv << [model.name, instance.id, attachment, url, file_name, content_type]
              puts "#{model.name}.find(#{instance.id}).#{attachment}.attach(io: File.open('#{url}'), filename: '#{file_name}', content_type: '#{content_type}')"
            end
          end
        end
      end
      puts "Saved to #{filename}"
    end
    
    task :import => :environment do
      Rails.application.eager_load!
      filename = "paperclip_attachments.csv"
      CSV.foreach(filename, :headers => true) do |row|
        command = "#{row['MODEL']}.find(#{row['ID']}).#{row['TYPE']}.attach(io: File.open(\"public#{row['URL'].gsub(/\?\d+/,"")}\"), filename: \"#{row['FILENAME']}\", content_type: '#{row['CONTENT_TYPE']}')"
        puts command
        begin
          eval(command)
        rescue => ex
          puts ex.message
        end
      end
    end
  end
  `````
  
Step 1: Export Paperclip

This is just a rake task.  Run this before you upgrade your code to use activestorage.  It will leave a file called paperclip_export.csv.
`````
rake attachments:export RAILS_ENV=development
`````
  
Step 2: Upgrade code to ActiveStorage

add /storage to .gitignore
This will migrate the database if you haven't already, and changes the code in models and views.  
rails active_storage:install
rake db:migrate
add gem "poppler" if you need to preview PDFs
add gem "image_processing" if you want to have image resizing

update any models that use paperclip (uses has_attached_file :attachment) to instead be has_one_attached :attachment.

if you had size variants defined with paperclip, you can do them in Views now in the image_tag. 
variants for images, or just representation for any model.attachment.representation(resize_to_fit: [980,980], convert: :png).processed
you can access file_size through the byte_size method, and file_name through the filename method of model.attachment

check if a file is attached by model.attachment.attached?

link to a file with <%=link_to @instance.attachment.filename, @instance.attachment %>

get the data from a file with File.open(@instance.attachment.download)

the .processed method calls or creates a preprocessed version.  always use processed in production

the original image URL can be gotten with url_for(instance.attachment)
Add :attachment to any safe_params in controller.  

If you want to use cloud in production, eg) azure, add 
gem "azure-storage-blob", require: false to Gemfile
and add config.active_storage.service = :microsoft to config/environments/production.rb
uncomment and fill in the chosen provider info in /config/storage.yml
rails credentials:edit --environment production if you need to add credentials


Step 3: Migrate to activestorage.
In step two, run another rake task to process this exported file and upload the content.

First clean our URL encodings:

sed -i 's/%20/ /g' paperclip_attachments.csv
sed -i 's/%23/#/g' paperclip_attachments.csv
sed -i 's/%28/(/g' paperclip_attachments.csv
sed -i 's/%29/)/g' paperclip_attachments.csv

Then:
`````
rake attachments:import RAILS_ENV=development
`````
