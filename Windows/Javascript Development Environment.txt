Javascript Developer Setup

The request is to have users able to change their node version and develop javascript under their limited privilege accounts.  The tools we use are
VS Code
Node.js (Windows Specific Version of NVM)
Github Desktop

Logged in as admin user:

Remove Existing Node (paraphrased from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20711240/how-to-completely-remove-node-js-from-windows)
Uninstall Node.js from add/remove programs
rmdir /S %AppData%\npm
rmdir /S %AppData%\npm-cache
Check %PATH% environment variable (System and end user) to ensure no references to Nodejs or npm exist.

Logged in as end user:

Install GitHub Desktop as admin
Install VS Code as admin
Install nvm-windows https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases and click nvm-setup.exe as admin
	customize root location to C:\nvm\
	customize the symlink location to C:\nvm\active\nodejs
Edit the users PATH environment variable.  Add %NVM_ROOT% and %NVM_SYMLINK%

open a command prompt
type "mkdir c:\nvm\active"

nvm install lts
nvm use (latest version from previous command) eg nvm use 18.14.0

Verify as end user:

Open command prompt:
nvm install latest
nvm use (output of latest version, eg 19.6.0)

Dev environment test as end user:
Open VS Code, go to View->Terminal and type "npm version"
Go to a project and type npm install and npm run start, if there is a Windows Firewall Warning, click allow and type in the end user's credentials
